# NBA-MAZE-PROJECT

# TECH USED
The technologies used to complete this project were the following
CSS
HTML
JAVA SCRIPT


# The approach
The approach i took for this project was making a interactive maze game and giving it a twist with something i enjoy which in this case was basketball
and my favorite team. I chose to go with the lakers and the theme of the maze is purple and gold just like the laker uniform. The goal of the game is to
guide the laker team to the nba championship, once achieved it will tell you how many steps it took to reach the title and let you start from scratch.
I implemented multiple levels to really challenge the player.

# UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
the unsolved problems in this project was getting the audio controls to blend with the whole theme.

# Animations

i went with simple but eye catching animations that do not distract the player too much from the game but add an extra kick to the experience.
